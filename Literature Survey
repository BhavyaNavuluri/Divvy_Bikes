# Title: Bicycle-Sharing System Analysis and Trip Prediction

# Abstract:— Bicycle-sharing systems, which can provide shared bike usage services for the public, have been launched in many big
cities. In bicycle-sharing systems, people can borrow and return bikes at any stations in the service region very conveniently.
Therefore, bicycle-sharing systems are normally used as a shortdistance trip supplement for private vehicles as well as regular
public transportation. Meanwhile, for stations located at different places in the service region, the bike usages can be quite 
skewed and imbalanced. Some stations have too many incoming bikes and get jammed without enough docks for upcoming bikes,  
while some other stations get empty quickly and lack enough bikes for people to check out. Therefore, inferring the potential
destinations and arriving time of each individual trip beforehand can effectively help the service providers schedule manual 
bike re-dispatch in advance. In this paper, we will study the individual trip prediction problem for bicycle-sharing systems. 
To address the problem, we study a real-world bicycle-sharing system and analyze individuals’ bike usage behaviors first. 
Based on the analysis results, a new trip destination prediction and trip duration inference model will be introduced. 
Experiments conducted on a real-world bicycle-sharing system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
